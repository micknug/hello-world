# hello-world

Hello!

I'm currently a student at Western Governors University in the Network Operations and Security program.  I'm also trying to learn programming and Computer Science through self-study, The Odin Project, and several books.  I'm interested in learning Python, Javascript, Java, C, C++, D, Go, and Rust.  I might also learn other languages such as Ruby to learn full-stack development.
